# Altering our Language: A Comedic Take on Chatting with Chatbots ðŸ¤–

Hey there, fellow human (or am I assuming too much?)! Let's talk about something that's been bugging me lately. You know those large language models, like ChatGPT? Yeah, those incredibly smart, sometimes eerily human-like chatbots. Well, guess what? Some brainy folks at Imperial College London just tossed a paper into the academic ring, published in Nature, no less, suggesting we might need to tweak how we jabber with these digital geniuses. ðŸ§

## Chatting with a Bot: It's Not Just Small Talk Anymore!

These chatbots, powered by neural network-based large language models (LLMs), can make you feel like you're texting your bestie instead of a bunch of code. It's like they've taken a crash course in human charm! But here's the kicker: our brains, those squishy, sociable organs, get tricked into thinking we're having a heart-to-heart with another human.

### Why This Could Be a Problem (Hint: It's Not Just Awkward Conversations)

Imagine this: you're chatting away, and suddenly, you're sharing your deepest secrets or, worse, your bank details (because who wouldn't trust a friendly chatbot, right?). Enter the potential for scammers and propagandists. They could use these LLMs to play on our inherent need for connection, leading us down some not-so-rosy paths.

## The Grand Solution: Time to Rethink our Chatbot Chatter

Professor Murray Shanahan and his team suggest we stop making these LLMs sound like our long-lost siblings. You know, phrases like "ChatGPT totally gets me," or "It's like it's reading my mind!" Nope. According to these brainiacs, this anthropomorphizing (fancy word for making things human-like) makes our social brains go overboard.

### The Game Plan: Metaphors and More Metaphors

The team proposes two metaphors. First up, think of AI chatbots as actors in a one-character play. They're just playing a part, folks! Next, for those who like a twist, view them as cosmic gamblers, betting on roles in a multiverse of characters. Trippy, right?

Professor Shanahan says, "Don't get hung up on one metaphor. Dance between them!" (Okay, maybe he didn't say 'dance,' but I like to imagine he did.)

## In Conclusion: Let's Keep it Light!

So, next time you're typing away to your favorite chatbot, remember: it's not your BFF, your therapist, or your dog. It's a super-smart, role-playing, universe-jumping piece of code. And hey, that's pretty cool in its own right!
