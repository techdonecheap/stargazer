# **Dana White's Pedal-Powered Protest at UFC**

## **No More Peloton Rides at UFC Performance Institute**

UFC's head honcho, Dana White, has just laid down the law: It's goodbye to Peloton bikes at the UFC Performance Institute. This drastic move comes after a comedic twist involving Theo Von and a controversial podcast episode.

### **The Peloton Problem**

Here's the scoop: Theo Von, a comedian and podcast host, was sponsored by Peloton. But trouble brewed when Peloton got twitchy over an episode featuring Robert Kennedy Jr. Dana White's reaction? A no-holds-barred verbal takedown of Peloton and their CEO, Barry McCarthy.

### **The Great Peloton Purge**

Dana didn't just stop at fiery words. He called in Craig Borsari, UFC’s EVP of Ops, and made it clear:

> "We’re getting rid of the Pelotons. Pelotons are out of the gym. That’s what you do. You stop using their products."

This isn't Dana's first rodeo with corporate clashes. He recalled a time a major sponsor tried to censor his political support and got a similar treatment.

### **The Aftermath**

Fast forward to the present: UFC's gym is now a Peloton-free zone. And Barry McCarthy? Well, he's probably rethinking that statement about everyone wanting to partner with Peloton, especially after Dana's fiery retort:

> "You sell stationary bikes, you clown. That guy is the typical pompous, arrogant jerk that I cannot stomach." - Dana White

### **Peloton's Rocky Road**

Peloton's journey isn't all smooth riding. They've hit a financial snag, with a hefty net loss and a plummeting stock price. Despite recent partnerships with the NBA and WNBA, Dana White's UFC has made it clear: They're not fans.
